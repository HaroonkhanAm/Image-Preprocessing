We are using Jupyter notebook and python 3 for this tutorial. For practice this tutorial first you should install 'Anaconda' from google then install 'Jupyter notebook' in Anaconda platform. After the installation of notebook install important Numpy Library. This notebook is available on Kaggle.

The image processing is a technique of preparing (cleaning and organizing) the image to make it suitable for a building and training Machine Learning models.
 In image processing converts the image data into a form that allows machine learning algorithms to solve it.

1. Capture 5 images and 1 video with the help of your Laptop's Camera using open-cv,
save them in a folder, load and plot in a subplot in your notebook.
2. Normalize any 1 image from the saved images in a folder between range of 0 - 1.
3. Convert the pixels having values greater than 150 to white color and the values smaller
than 150 to black color without using open-cv then plot and save.
4. Do the 3rd task with the help of open-cv then plot and save.
5. Create a 1D array of 10000 random values, convert it into a 2D array of 100x100 pixels
having 3 channels (RGB) then plot and save.
6. Using the image created in task 6, crop a 10x10 portion from the center then plot and
save.
7. Blur an image (with Gaussian Blur) using open-cv.
8. In an image, add number 10 to each pixel value and don't add if the pixel value exceeds
number 240 after adding then plot and save.
9. In an image, subtract number 10 from each pixel value and don't subtract if the pixel
value falls behind number 10 after subtraction then plot and save.
10. Capture a picture of a ceiling bulb with your phone and make the bright area white and
the rest of the area black then plot and save.
11. Resize an image.
